# Haiku Generator

Overview

This project is a simple Java program that generates random Haikus, a traditional form of Japanese poetry. A Haiku typically consists of three lines with a syllable pattern of 5-7-5. While this program does not strictly adhere to the syllable structure, it creates poetic, nature-inspired lines by randomly combining nouns, verbs, and adjectives.

Features

	•	Generates a new Haiku every time the program runs.
	•	Uses random combinations of nature-themed words to create simple and evocative poetry.
	•	Lightweight and easy to customize.

How It Works

	1.	The program defines three arrays: nouns, verbs, and adjectives.
	2.	Each array contains a set of words related to nature or emotions.
	3.	A random word is selected from each array to form:
	•	Line 1: Adjective + Noun
	•	Line 2: Noun + Verb + Adjective
	•	Line 3: Noun + Adjective
	4.	The Haiku is then printed to the console.

Customization

	•	Expand the vocabulary: Add more words to the nouns, verbs, and adjectives arrays to create more diverse Haikus.
	•	Adjust the structure: Modify how the lines are formed for a unique poetic style.
	•	Enforce syllable rules: Introduce logic to ensure the generated Haikus match the traditional 5-7-5 syllable structure.

Inspiration

Haikus are known for their simplicity and their focus on nature and fleeting moments. This project is a fun way to practice Java programming while creating something artistic and meaningful.
